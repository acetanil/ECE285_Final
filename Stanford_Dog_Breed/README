For more information about the dataset, please visit the dataset website:
  http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/

If you use this dataset in a publication, please cite the dataset as
described on the website.

File Information:
 - images/
    -- Images of different breeds are in separate folders
 - annotations/
    -- Bounding box annotations of images
 - file_list.mat
    -- List of all files in the dataset
 - train_list.mat
    -- List and labels of all training images in dataset
 - test_list.mat
    -- List and labels of all test images in dataset

Train splits:
 In order to test with fewer than 100 images per class, the first
 n indices for each class in train_list.mat were used, where n is
 the number of training images per class.

Features (train_data.mat, test_data.mat):
 - train_data/test_data
   -- contains the feature matrix after histogram intersection kernel has been applied
 - train_fg_data/test_fg_data
   -- contains the feature matrix before applying the histogram intersection kernel
 - train_info/test_info
   -- contains the labels and ids for the corresponding image in the feature matrix
